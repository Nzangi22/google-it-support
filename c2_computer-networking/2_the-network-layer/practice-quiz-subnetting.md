## Subnetting

### Question 1

What does CIDR stand for?

* Classless Internet Destination Routing
* Classfull Inter-Destination Routing
* **Classless Inter-Domain Routing**
* Classfull Identification Routing

> CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.

### Question 2

Which of the following is a correct form of CIDR notation?

* 192.168.1.0:24
* **192.168.1.0/24**
* 192.168.1.0\24
* 192.168.1.0 + 255.255.255.0

> CIDR notation uses a forward slash and then lists the numbers of bits in the subnet mask.

### Question 3

How many octets does a subnet mask have?

* 1
* 2
* 3
* **4**

> A subnet mask is the same length as an IP address.
> ### Question 4 
> Consider the following scenario:
Your IP address is 192.168.8.34, and your subnet mask is 255.255.0.0. What part of the subnet mask represents the subnet ID?
*  **The first two octets of the subnet mask, 255.255**
* The last two octets of the subnet mask, 0.0
* 192.168.0.254
* 255.255.0.1
* ### Question 5
* How many possible host IDs do you always lose per network?
* 4
* 12
* 8
* **2**
